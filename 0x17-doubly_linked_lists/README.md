My apologies! Here's the revised README with the same detailed approach as before:

## Doubly Linked Lists Project

This repository contains a collection of C programs implementing various functions for working with doubly linked lists. Each program is associated with a specific task, and they are part of a broader educational project aimed at mastering the concepts of linked lists in the C programming language.

### Tasks Overview

1. **Print list:** A function that prints all the elements of a `dlistint_t` list.

2. **List length:** A function that returns the number of elements in a linked `dlistint_t` list.

3. **Add node:** A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `dlistint_t` list.

4. **Add node at the end:** A function that adds a new node at the end of a `dlistint_t` list.

5. **Free list:** A function that frees a `dlistint_t` list.

6. **Get node at index:** A function that returns the nth node of a `dlistint_t` linked list.

7. **Sum list:** A function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `dlistint_t` linked list.

8. **Insert at index:** A function that inserts a new node at a given position in a `dlistint_t` list.

9. **Delete at index:** A function that deletes the node at a specified index of a `dlistint_t` linked list.

10. **Crackme4:** Finding the password for a given crackme program and saving it in a file.

11. **Palindromes:** Finding the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers and saving the result in a file.

12. **Crackme5 Keygen:** Writing a keygen for a given crackme program that generates a valid key for a specified username.

### File Structure

Each task has its own set of files:

- `X-main.c`: Main C file containing the test cases for the respective task.
- `X-<function_name>.c`: Implementation file for the respective task.
- `lists.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and struct definition.
- `<username>.txt`: Files containing the passwords or results, as required by specific tasks.

### How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of the test cases, use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 X-main.c X-<function_name>.c 0-print_dlistint.c -o <output_filename>
./<output_filename>
```
